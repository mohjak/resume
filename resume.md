Flexibility, Problem Solving, Detail Oriented, Listening, Continues Learning, and Teamwork are words that describes me well. Because I am a very good team player I always start with new teams quickly and efficiently. I always bring new ideas, and easily motivated to learn new things. I always care about focusing on critical issues. I find I work best in a medium sized organizations.
